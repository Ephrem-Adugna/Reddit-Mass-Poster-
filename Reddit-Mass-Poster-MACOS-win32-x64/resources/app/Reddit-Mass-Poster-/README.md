A desktop app for quickly posting links or youtube videos across multiple subreddits at once. 
## To get Started:
  1. Clone all files into your computer
  2. Create a reddit app at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps and make sure to make it a script instead of a web app or installed app
  3. Run the ```YoutubeAdvert.exe``` file in the downloaded sub folder based on your operating system.
  4. Input the client secret and id from your reddit app
  5. Enter the username and password you used when creating the app
  6. Choose whether you want to post a link, or link from an actual youtube channel
## Post a link
1. Type in the title you want followed by the link you want to post. Type in the subreddit names you want to post to. If for some reason you only want to post to one                 subreddit, add a space at the end of it.
2. Click the play button. Check if your posts were posted on your account. If you are encountering any issues feel free to create an issue and speak about it there.
